# WeTube
**FIRST OF ALL => Feel free to Fork, create pull request and load issues. It is OPEN SOURCE :)**

<br>

## What do I have in my mind? 
I will recreate the Youtube platform. I want to improve my skills in Java Spring Boot, Hibernate, Unit Test, VueJS, Request between APIs, HTTP Response Codes and a little bit Front End. My idea is create an API with Spring Boot that it is consumed by my frontend application, interacting with it endpoints and getting a response code and a body.
